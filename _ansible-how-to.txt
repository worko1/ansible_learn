COMMENTS: has to start with '#'
BASIC TEST: ansible [xxx] -m ping -vvv

BOOLEAN:
  you can represent a boolean in a list with 'off' , 'no' , 'false'

LIST:
  are being created with a "-" , eg.:
    - bmw 3
    - mercedes e180
    - audi
    - no
    - 32.7
    
  # LIST in YAML compressed format look like this:
  [whatever, 15, 848.2, false, true, AHOJ]
    
DICT:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
  key3: value3
  ip_addr: 10.12.13.1
  password: pass123
  username: admin
  
  # DICT in YAML compressed format look like this:
  {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3 }
  
DICT with list as values:
    dict_list: 
      - list_value1
      - list_value2
      - list_value3
      - 10
      - true

LIST with dict as items:
  - ip_addr: 10.10.10.1
     username: admin
     password: pass1
     device_type: cisco
  -  ip_addr: 10.10.10.2
     username: admin
     password: pass2
     device_type: nxos

-------------------------------------------------------

INVENTORY:
	- by default it looks in /etc/ansible/host
	- Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be processed in the following order:
		1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)
		2. ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
		3. .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
		4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
	
	- create a local ansible.cfg file in your working directory and edit it:
		> touch ansible.cfg
	
	- 'ansible-hosts' file
		[local]
		localhost ansible_connection=local  (do not SSH to device, because it is local)
		
VARIABLES:
	- Group VARs: external variables for specific groups have to be in a relative 
	  directory called 'group_vars' and specified as [hosts_name].yml file. The filename is 
	  in other words the name of the group [hosts_name]. E.g. cisco.yml for [cisco]
	  
	- HOST VARs: external variables for specific hosts/targets have to be in a relative 
	  directory called 'host_vars' and subdir called 'hostname'. The variable name is
	  not to be specific.
	  
	- VARs can also be defined insed the playbook itself as:
		vars:
		  var1: value1
		  var2: value2
		  
	- VARs can also be gathered from a file as:
		vars_files:
		  - my_variables_file.yml
		  
	- FACTS: are special variables gathered from the targets. You can get the local
	  facts as a dictionary by typing 'ansible local -m setup -v' and then use the keys
	  in your playbook. 
	  
SSH-PROBLEMS:
	- if you always get FATAL with SSH target unreachable, do on the client maschine following:
		1. ssh first to the remota maschine as 'ssh user@remote_ip'
		2. ssh-copy-id -i user@localhost
		3. ssh-copy-id -i user@servers_in_inventory
		
	  > If you are not using an SSH manager, run ssh-add and if you get back
	    'Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.' , 
		then run > eval $(ssh-agent) 
		and repeat > ssh-add
		
MODULES that need ROOT/SUDO:
	Add --user=USERNAME --extra-vars "ansible_sudo_pass=PASSWORD" at the end
	> ansible-playbook modules_pb.yml -i ./ansible-hosts --user=user --extra-vars "ansible_sudo_pass=pas123"
